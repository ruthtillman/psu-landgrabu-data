# Penn State LandGrabU Data

Penn State-specific spreadsheet data derived from the [LandGrabU](https://github.com/HCN-Digital-Projects/landgrabu-data) project.

## Files

* `PSU_parcels` files are derived from the original Parcels.csv, limited to only parcels allotted to Penn States.
* `LandGrabUTable.xlsx` is a list of each Tribal Nation whose land was sold to form Penn State's endowment. Each nation links to the landgrabu.org site's visualizations. Each row includes the number of sessions and acres, the amount the U.S. paid, the amount Penn State University raised, and return on investment.
